　　地球是圆的，以是当咱们走得充满远时，大概，大概还能团聚。然而咱们还会连接那残断的梦吗?徽英说不领会，我也说不领会。我只想把我那火的恋情，就放在余生，任由他去焚烧，去烧掉我的肉体。
/>　　人们对酒的态度可谓多种多样。有人视酒为洪水猛兽，有人却嗜之如命。　　酒有舒筋活血、祛寒暖胃、消肿止痛等功效，少饮健身，过量损身，这是中医对酒的认识。然而，绝大多数人饮酒并不是取其药用性能。酒能刺激人的神经，使人的精神处于高度亢奋状态；酒也能麻痹人的神经，使人的精神达到极度的抑制。人们爱酒，是取其可壮浩气、驱除苦闷、舒展筋骨、激人兴奋的一面；人们避酒，是惧其长饮损身、过量乱性、有碍君子形象的一面。　　不论是设场聚饮，还是个人独酌，都与一种目的性相联系。年节祝福，婚丧酬答，喜事庆贺，无酒不成宴席；亲朋相聚，知己来访，没酒不成气氛；事成高兴，心情郁闷，心劳体乏，也要借酒发挥和排释。有一些老年人，大半生辛苦劳作，身体的零部件多已磨损，要依赖酒来启动维持；内心的苦水淤积爆满，要依赖酒来疏通缓解。　　曹孟德说：对酒当歌，人生几何？譬如朝露，去日苦多。作为一代枭雄的大政治家、大军事家，也会发出如此感慨。酒与军人关系甚大，古代的张飞、关羽，现代的许世友、李云龙之辈，莫不是酒壮英雄本色。酒与文人更是有不解之缘，李白斗酒诗百篇，饮尽人间美酒，抒发万丈豪情，谱写了千古不朽的诗酒人生。酒文化与中国的历史一样，源远流长。走遍中华大地，无论你到了哪里，无论是语言风俗习惯多么的不相同，你都会听到传唱于民间千百年的各式各样的祝酒歌、敬酒曲、劝酒调、把酒谣，真可谓一杯浊酒喜相逢，古今多少事，都付笑谈中。　　相传，酒是杜康发明酿造的。单从“杜”这个姓氏来考证，其历史不超过三千年。而酒的历史要比这个姓氏的形成久远得多。我们可以想象，在上古而又上古的时期，果子熟了，堆于树下，日久发酵，变为果酒。一群类人猿来到树下，被果酒浓郁的醇香所吸引，但他们不敢贸然去饮食，其中有敢为天下先者，拼却性命率先一尝，如同神附其身，顿觉天花乱坠，美妙绝伦。于是，如同神授的一次意外发现竟成了一个伟大的发明，有心人依照自然之法如是炮制，变天然形成为人工酿造，酒就来到了人间社会，成了与人俱来的特殊饮品。当然，这仅是在下的推测，不足为信。　　有成事者酒、败事者亦酒的说法。成事者酒的典型范例，莫过于宋太祖杯酒释兵权的典故。周瑜假借醉酒，致使蒋干中计，也是一种高超艺术。许多政治家或政客，玩弄权术考验部下的方法，也是醉之以酒，然后观察其言行。酒后失密，导致杀身之祸的例子，举不胜举。因而，举凡想做大事者，皆慎于饮酒。历史上许多才高八斗、学富五车之人，终身不仕或得不到重用，也是因为嗜酒。书生治国，本来就有缺陷，且又好这一口，就更有碍于致仕做官、管理国家事务了。张飞假装酒醉，麻痹于敌，屡屡出奇制胜；但他最终还是死在了酒后的暴戾不宽上。　　不求闻达于世的文人小民，没有过多的顾忌，酒后失态，嬉笑怒骂，吹牛放屁，袒胸露腹，高吟低唱，旁若无人。茅台、五粮液等国酒买的人不喝，喝的人不买，文人小民不去奢望渴求，但有一瓶二锅头，已是心满意足，只要是粮食酿造的就行。一万块钱一瓶的酒，跟两块钱一瓶的酒，在效果上都是一样的，照样喝得你神魂颠倒，六神无主，放浪形骸。　　酒不醉人人自醉，是说人在任何时候都是主体，醉与不醉，完全在于你对酒的把握，对酒的主宰。酒本身没有好与坏的属性，你诚心要醉，怪不得酒；你诚心不喝，酒也不会主动去招惹你。骂酒是坏东西，那是在骂自己！对待酒，和对待权力、金钱、美女一样，为主为奴，全在于你，宾主倒置，走向反面，你是难逃其咎的。　　对文人来说，诗酒人生是很理想的。采菊东篱下的悠然，把酒问青天的豪放，置酒话桑麻的恬淡，一樽还酹江月的胸怀，是对世俗红尘的了然态度。借助美酒，寄情山水，与世无争，与人和谐，归于自然，没有怀才不遇的的愤懑，没有患得患失的灰冷，没有生老病死的惊惧，来则来，去则去，那是再好不过的了。然而，农耕时代已经离我们渐渐远去，后工业时代和信息时代正在改变我们的生活，何取何从，不容回避。万里长征，始于足下，为壮行色，来，干一杯！　　------我谨保证我是此作品的作者，同意将此作品发表于中财论坛。并保证，在此之前不存在任何限制发表之情形，否则本人愿承担一切法律责任。谨授权浙江中财招商投资集团有限公司全权负责本作品的发表和转载等相关事宜，未经浙江中财招商投资集团有限公司授权，其他媒体一律不得转载。
　　如果把莫高窟所有的壁画连接起来，长达50华里。在这样一个长和的画廊里，从十六国经隋唐到宋元，不同的风格，不同的流派，形成了各有特色的有的富丽华艳，绚烂多彩。在艺术上，这些壁画不仅体现了中国的民族风格，而且吸取了印度、希腊、伊朗等国古代艺术之长，堪称是东、西方艺术的结晶。　　多少年来，有不少艺术家来到郭煌，为这座艺术宝库所吸引，宁愿放弃城市中优越的生活条件，在这个偏僻的沙漠小镇上住下，临摹壁画，向古代的艺术家学习，过着艰苦的生活，一呆就是几年，甚至大半辈子。
Since his father died, mother changed a person, as if the whole no more words, no longer cry.
Every time we speak in the home, she is in the side listen, no longer as before, into two sentences, then smiled.
Looked at me very sad, not the father, in the home have no forever the warmth of the past.
Father cremated a few days, the mother was found to have high blood pressure, was very high.
I bought her a automatic pressure meter, and she wants to take the tablets with different colors to distinguish, and posted on her bed, tell her how much in blood pressure, which a few kinds of color to take medicine, but also she has to know these words.
After you come back, often make a phone call to ask, because she seldom get sick, don't habit, I always worried about her will to reduce dosage, and sure enough, she always forget to eat at the beginning, or eat less half.
To this end, I always can't control his bad temper.
Once unexpectedly fell off and lost my phone one sentence: "I no matter you anymore."
Then, a man sat in the telephone crying, crying out, would be called and she said slowly.
There are a lot of time, I will suddenly woke up from my dream, thinking of her exactly have take medicine today?
Think is going to make a phone call to ask, but again afraid wake her up in the middle of the night, just want to wait for the morning call, but were afraid of the night, I forgot to, then how to also can not sleep then go.
Mother said, we are not too long.
Ancestors didn't really a "longevity", even 70 years or older are very rare.
When we are young, my grandfather grandmother away from us.
But at that time, we don't know, what it means for family life.
Now, after the departure of his father, we suddenly feel the treasure to the mother and the children's responsibility.
A colleague said, if a wife died in the old couple, another must be three years before being, after 3 years, such as your mother will be okay.
Is his father died on September 29, 97, at the age of 65.
I insisted that date is on September 30, 1997, his father died, because I was 30, to get back home, father's head, when I returned home touch his ears were still hot, and, at that time my brother also confirmed that he felt his father's ear is hot, even if it is not true, I also firmly believe that, that day, the soul of the father is our home, he saw our pain, more saw my mother's helpless!
The 73 - year - old mother and father age, blood pressure is still high, but the days like a pendulum, can need not worry about medication regularly, timing with 27 to the field for a walk in the morning, afternoon to play small card, so I can hear the laughter of the young and she, villagers said that she is a man of good fortune.
I dedicate this memory of my father, to my mother.
The 2005-9-26 night
Some party members and cadres in the work, with "for regional development, and benefit for the people", in the name of the quick buck, the blind pursuit of performance, the pursuit of the effect, finally achieves twice.

In training guide, think ahead.
